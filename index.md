I'm Tim Poisot. I do (mostly theoretical) [research](/research/) on ecological
networks and community ecology, [write papers](/papers/), and [blog](/blog/). I
also release [free open-source software][github] and [datasets][figshare].

I am an assistant professor in numerical/quantitative/computational ecology (I
do theory-based research, is what I'm saying!) at the Université de Montréal.
You can check out the [group website][plab].

From May to December 2014, I was a post-doctoral fellow at the [Stouffer
lab](http://stoufferlab.org/), at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand.
From late 2011 to early 2014, I was a post-doctoral fellow in [the group of
Dominique Gravel][uqar] at the Université du Québec à Rimouski. I'm involved in
the [Québec Centre for Biodiversity Sciences][qcbs], the [French Ecological
Society][sfe], and the [International Network of Next-Generation
Ecologists](http://innge.net/).
